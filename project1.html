        I taught my final course in Fall 2019. You can view a <a
            href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms">video of my last lecture</a>,
        which was not about computer science.

        Khan Academy now carries <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms"> algorithms
            tutorials</a> for which <a href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/devin/"> Devin Balkcom</a> and I produced
        content.

        My newest book is <i>Algorithms Unlocked.</i>The Amazon site for the book is <a

        site is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-unlocked">here</a>.
        <br>
        I maintain an <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/au-bugs/bugs-1e.php">errata page</a> for <i>Algorithms
            Unlocked</i>. If you find an error in the book and it's not already in the <a

        (The email address in the preface of the book is incorrectâ€”the first known

        I receive many requests from students outside Dartmouth who want to work with me as interns. I do not take
        interns from outside Dartmouth.

        <br>
        <br>
        I occasionally teach a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish
        a<a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/Cormen-rules.pdf">list of usage rules</a> that I require my students

            Introduction to Algorithms

    </h4>

    <p>
        Yes, I am the coauthor of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>,along with <a
            href="http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/~cel">Charles Leiserson</a>, <a
            href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest">Ron Rivest,</a> and <a
            href="https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/~cs2035">Cliff Stein.</a>
        For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about <a
            href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/1990-introduction-algorithms">the secret to writing a best-selling
            textbook.</a><br>
        <br>
        Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about <i> Introduction to Algorithms:</i> <br>
        <br>
        <i>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available? </i>
        <dd>
            We are currently working on the fourth edition. No public release date has been set. If you're wondering
            whether to hold off buying the third edition in anticipation of the fourth edition, I advise you not to
            wait.
        </dd><br>
        <br>

        <i>Where is the website for the book?</i>
        <dd>The MIT Press site is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition"></a>
            http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms.</dd>
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Where can I find a list of a errata?</i>
        <dd>We maintain an <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrs-bugs/bugs-3e.php"> errata page</a> that
            allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental
            update feature, allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about.</dd>
